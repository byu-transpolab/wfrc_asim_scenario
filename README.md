# WFRC ASIM Scenario

This is a repository with an ActivitySim implementation of the WFRC area (SLC,
Utah).

## Running

This uses ActivitySim to run.... Please see [the
documentation](https://activitysim.github.io/activitysim/v1.2.0/users-guide/index.html#userguide)
for how to set up and run ActivitySim using Mambaforge. This includes
installing on the BYU supercomputer. You may need to edit the `PATH` in order
to run Mambaforge commands since it is installed locally.
