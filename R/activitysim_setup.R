#'  The ActivitySim Model requires an input of specific socioeconomic (SE) data
#  for certain counties in the Wasatch Front (Box Elder, Weber, Davis, Salt Lake,
#  Utah). This data can also be classified as landuse data. This document
#  explains what data is needed, where the data comes from, and how the data is
#  changed into the correct format in order to be processed.
#  
#  The socioeconomic file requires 42 different inputs which can be described as
#  different column headings. These headings are copied directly from the
#  ActivitySim Example's input file. The headings are the following:
#  
#  > ##### ZONE, DISTRICT, SD, COUNTY, TOTHH, HHPOP, TOTPOP, EMPRES, SFDU, MFDU,
#  HHINCQ1, HHINCQ2, HHINCQ3, HHINCQ4, TOTACRE, RESACRE, CIACRE, SHPOP62P,
#  TOTEMP, AGE0004, AGE0519, AGE2044, AGE4564, AGE65P, RETEMPN, FPSEMPN, HEREMPN,
#  OTHEMPN, AGREMPN, MWTEMPN, PRKCST, OPRKCST, area_type, HSENROLL, COLLFTE,
#  COLLPTE, TOPOLOGY, TERMINAL, ZERO, hhlds, sftaz, gqpop, geometry
#  
#  The description for each column heading can be found at this link:
#  https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/modeling-website/wiki/TazData
#  
#  The next section describes the data input sources, and then the rest of the
#  page describes how each of the 42 sections are calculated using the data
#  sources. A final table is created at the end. Specifically, the final results
#  are presented as a csv file named land_use.csv.

#' Make college enrollment data

#'   listed. The websites for these can be seen in the data source column of
#'   that table. Some data wasn't found on the web, so data from WFRC's college

#'  WFRC only had information on total enrolled students, so part time students
#'  for these colleges is represented as 0, even if that is not necessarily
#'  true. This is why data from the web was prioritized over the WFRC
#'  information (it had part time student data). Also, not all the "Higher
